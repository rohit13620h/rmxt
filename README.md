## Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check the **[Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md)** for solutions to common problems:

- Installation and compilation issues
- Permission and access problems  
- Recovery and trash system issues
- Platform-specific problems
- Performance and integration issues

## Cross-Platform Support

rmxt integrates with native system trash implementations across platforms:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/Trash/files/` (XDG specification)
- **macOS**: `~/.Trash/` (Finder integration)
- **Windows**: Recycle Bin (native integration)

The exact location is managed by the system's trash implementation, ensuring compatibility with your desktop environment.
