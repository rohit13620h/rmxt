### Common Commands
```bash

rmxt -r directory/              # Remove directory recursively
rmxt list                       # Show trash contents
rmxt recover file.txt           # Recover specific file
rmxt recover-all               # Recover all files
rmxt tidy                      # Clean old files (30+ days)

# Time-based operations
rmxt list -t 7                 # Files deleted in last 7 days
rmxt recover-all -t 1          # Recover today's deletions
rmxt tidy -t 60                # Clean files older than 60 days

# Shell integration
alias rm='rmxt'                # Replace rm with rmxt
```

- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows
